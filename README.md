<p>
The SLA plan and the priority level of the ticket can be adjusted depending on the severity of the issue. For this randomized scenario, the priority level is modified to "Emergency" along with the customized SLA plan, SEV-A, which indicates the issue will significantly impact a business if not resolved immediately. In some cases, the customers can stipulate a designated SLA plan for the agent.
